# Upload Cypress videos and screenshots directly to Slack

This Github action enables you to take the screenshots and videos generated by Cypress after a test run and upload them directly to a Slack channel of your choice. All files are contained within a single message thread to minimize noise.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** Slack app token. See [Bot tokens](https://docs.slack.dev/authentication/tokens/#bot)

- [Create an app](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings)
- [Request scopes](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings#scopes) for `files:write`, `chat:write` and `channels:read`
- [Install the app into your workspace](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings#installing)
<!-- - Invite the bot to whatever channels you want to send the videos and screenshots to `/invite <botname>` -->
- Grab the `Bot User OAuth Token` from the `OAuth & Permissions` page
- Add that token as a secret to your Github repo's `Actions Secrets` found under `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions` (in the examples below we call it `SLACK_TOKEN`)

### `channel`

**Required** Slack channel to upload to

### `workdir`

**Optional** The folder where Cypress stores screenshots and videos on the build machine.

Default: `cypress`

(this relative path resolves to `/home/runner/work/<REPO_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>/cypress`)

If your project uses Cypress from the project root folder, the default value will work for you.
But if your project uses Cypress in a subfolder (like most monorepos), you'll need to provide the relative path to that folder
(i.e. `e2e/cypress`).
(Don't include a trailing slash on your path!)

### `message-text`

**Optional** Custom Slack message text.

Default: `A Cypress test just finished. I've placed the screenshots and videos in this thread. Good pie!`

## Examples

### Upload results after every push

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test-and-upload-results:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Run tests'
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2

      - name: 'Upload screenshots and videos to Slack'
        uses: trymbill/cypress-slack-video-upload-action@v1.3.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
          channels: 'engineering-ops'
```

### Only upload when open PRs fail

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test-and-upload-results-on-fail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Run tests'
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2

      - name: 'Upload screenshots and videos to Slack'
        uses: trymbill/cypress-slack-video-upload-action@v1.3.0
        if: failure()
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
          channels: 'engineering-ops'
          message-text: 'Cypress tests failed! They have been placed in this thread, good luck.'
```
