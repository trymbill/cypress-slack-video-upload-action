# Upload Cypress videos and screenshots directly to Slack

This Github action enables you to take the screenshots and videos generated by Cypress after a test run and upload them directly to a Slack channel of your choice. All files are contained within a single message thread to minimize noise.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** Slack app token. See [Bot tokens](https://docs.slack.dev/authentication/tokens/#bot)

- [Create an app](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings)
- [Request scopes](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings#scopes) for `files:write`, `chat:write` and `channels:read`
- [Install the app into your workspace](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings#installing)
- Invite the bot to whatever channel you want to send the videos and screenshots to `/invite <botname>`
- Grab the `Bot User OAuth Token` from the `OAuth & Permissions` page
- Add that token as a secret to your Github repo's `Actions Secrets` found under `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions` (in the examples below we call it `SLACK_TOKEN`)

### `channel`

**Required** Slack channel to upload to

### `workdir`

**Optional** The folder where Cypress stores screenshots and videos on the build machine.

Default: `cypress`

(this relative path resolves to `/home/runner/work/<REPO_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>/cypress`)

If your project uses Cypress from the project root folder, the default value will work for you.
But if your project uses Cypress in a subfolder (like most monorepos), you'll need to provide the relative path to that folder
(i.e. `e2e/cypress`).
(Don't include a trailing slash on your path!)

### `message-text`

**Optional** Custom Slack message text.

Default: `A Cypress test just finished. I've placed the screenshots and videos in this thread. Good pie!`

## Examples

### Upload results after every push

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test-and-upload-results:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Run tests'
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2

      - name: 'Upload screenshots and videos to Slack'
        uses: trymbill/cypress-slack-video-upload-action@v1.3.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
          channel: 'engineering-ops'
```

### Only upload when open PRs fail

```yml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test-and-upload-results-on-fail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Run tests'
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2

      - name: 'Upload screenshots and videos to Slack'
        uses: trymbill/cypress-slack-video-upload-action@v1.3.0
        if: failure()
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
          channel: 'engineering-ops'
          message-text: 'Cypress tests failed! They have been placed in this thread, good luck.'
```

## Testing

This repository includes a test setup to verify the action works correctly.

### Running Tests Locally

1. Build, lint and package the action:

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

2. Run Cypress tests:

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm run cypress:run

   # Run specific test
   npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/passing.cy.js
   npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/failing.cy.js

   # Open Cypress UI (for interactive testing)
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

3. Test the Slack upload action locally:

   ```bash
   # After running a failing test, you can test the action manually
   # @actions/core reads from INPUT_* environment variables when running locally
   INPUT_TOKEN=your_token INPUT_CHANNEL=your_channel node dist/main.js

   # Optional: specify workdir and custom message
   INPUT_TOKEN=your_token INPUT_CHANNEL=your_channel INPUT_WORKDIR=cypress INPUT_MESSAGE_TEXT="Test message" node dist/main.js
   ```

### CI Testing

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) that:

- Runs on pull requests
- Executes both passing and failing Cypress tests
- Verifies the Slack upload action completes successfully

**Required Secrets:**

For the CI workflow to work, you need to set up the following secrets in your repository:

- `SLACK_TOKEN`: Your Slack bot token (required)
- `SLACK_CHANNEL`: The Slack channel name to send test results to (optional, defaults to 'general')

To set up secrets:

1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to `Secrets and variables -> Actions`
3. Click `New repository secret`
4. Add `SLACK_TOKEN` with your bot token
5. Optionally add `SLACK_CHANNEL` with your desired channel name

The workflow will automatically run on pull requests and verify that:

- Passing tests complete successfully
- Failing tests generate screenshots and videos
- The Slack upload action successfully uploads artifacts without errors

## Releasing

### Publishing new release

`npm run all`
`git add --all`
`git commit -m "bump version"`
`git tag -a -m "My first action release" v1.2`
`git push --follow-tags`
